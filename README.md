## Overview
This cool plugin was built as a part of the [Plan B Network](https://planb.network/en/) tech school. Students were randomly selected to complete a given assignment created by the mentors of some of the best Bitcoin companies in the industry. Build a new plugin for the BTCPay ecosystem for a chance to win a trip to El Salvador to spend a week building with Bitcoin developer legends.

## 🎨 Key Features
* UI extension for users to accept their fortune from Satoshi Nakomoto
* Use with every invoice paid regardless of PoS, Crowdsource, or external plugin

## 📗 Documentation
This plugin was built using the BTCPay [Plugin documentation](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Development/Plugins/). 

## 🚀 Future Features
* New fortune created every 10min based on block creation timing
* Block number listed at bottom of each fortune
* New fortunes sent to BTCPay db in lieu of csv
